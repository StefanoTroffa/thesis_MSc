# Thesis Work of Stefano Troffa for the MSc in Theoretical Physics at Leiden University

This project aims to replicate the results presented in the paper [Title of Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06390) by [Authors], focusing on [brief description of the main objective or findings of the paper].

## Code Structure

The code is organized into several key components:

- **compgraph**: Contains folders with helper functions and a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the basic implementation of the project's core idea.

## Project Description

The purpose of this codebase is to compute approximate ground states using a computational graph. This method serves as a proxy for the ansatz that generates the wave function weights, an innovative approach first introduced by Carleo in 2016. For more information, see the paper ["Title of Carleo's Paper"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02318).

## Specific Neural Network Model

The neural network model explored in this project is built upon Sonnet modules, designed to recreate a pipeline similar to that described in the main reference paper. Detailed implementation and methodology can be found within the codebase.
